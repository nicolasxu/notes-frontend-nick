1. trim details to focus on big picture(core function or challenges)
2. Transactions is abstraction of database

3. RPC (remote procedure call) as communication mechanism
  - pro: high performance and simple abstraction
  - server stub
  - client stub

4. consistency Models
    Strongest consistency
    Weakest consistency
    Eventual consistency -> casual consistency -> sequential consistency -> strict (linearizability) consistency
    (weak)                                                                  (strong)
  - Eventual consistency ensures high availability
    e.g.: - domain name system
          - Cassandra is a highly available NoSQL database that provides eventual consistency.
  - strict consistency
    e.g.: changing password

5. failure models
  - Fail-stop
  - Crash
  - Omission failures#
  - Temporal failures#
  - Byzantine failures#
