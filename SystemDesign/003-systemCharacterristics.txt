Non-functional System Characteristics


- Availability
  99.99% (4 nines) 52.56 minutes down time per year
- reliability
  mean time between failures (MTBF)
- Scalability
  - Request workload
  - Data/storage workload

  - Vertical scalability—scaling up#
  - Horizontal scalability—scaling out#

- Maintainability
  - Operability
  - Lucidity (simplicity of the code)
  - Modifiability

  - How to measure: (mean time to repair) MTTR
  - The only difference between them is the variable of interest
    - Maintainability refers to time-to-repair/change due to requirement changes and normal wear and tear
    - Reliability refers to both time-to-repair and the time-to-failure


  - Fault Tolerance, how
    - Replication
    - Checkpointing
